                <h4> * Green Papaya Salad (Tam Mak Hoong) *</h4>
                <p>Green Papaya Salad is typically made with shreds of unripe papaya. It is of Lao origin, but served in different varieties around the region.

Other ingredients include palm sugar, lime, garlic, tomatoes, dried shrimp, chilis, and raw eggplant. All of these ingredients are pounded together in a traditional mortar and pestle.</p>
